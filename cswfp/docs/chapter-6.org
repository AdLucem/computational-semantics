#+TITLE: Model Checking With Predicate Logic
#+AUTHOR: C.A.L

Oh they fucking finally tell us how predicate logic is going to be applied to natural semantics.
Yay.

* Predicate Logic as Representation Language

Predicate logic gives us representation for two types:

  - Entities :: Terms
  - Truth Values :: Formulas

# pg 128, note 1 : is separating complex subjects from simple subjects really a good idea?
# pg 128, note 2: an appropriate variable for v can be found using those semantic category hierarchies, maybe?
* Argument Reducing Functions

** Passivisation
** Reflexive pronouns
* Evaluating Formulas in Models

How to evaluate formulas of predicate logic with respect to models.

Things needed:

    + Interpretation functions :: 
      - A function from relation names to appropriate relations in the model
      - In our implementation, we do not differentiate according to the arity of the relation 
    + Variable assignments

# lol, I can understand jack shit. I'mma go back to the previous chapter now and study it
