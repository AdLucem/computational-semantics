#+TITLE: Computational Semantics With Functional Programming
#+AUTHOR: C.A.L


Notes, comments and implementation of the textbook ~Computational Semantics With Functional Semantics~.

The textbook deals with the teaching (alongside with the implementation) of Montagovian Semantics, a type of semantics that uses typed lambda calculus as its base.

# Comments from the author:
# I will probably skip some of the linguistic material in the notes
# as I already have background knowledge of it. I might also make 
# side-notes on typed lambda calculus, as I do not have knowledge
# of that.
